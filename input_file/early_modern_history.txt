 However, his brother, later James II, made no secret of his desire to return England to Catholicism, and people began to take sides well before Charles death
 Human history is largely a history of progress 6
 This culminated in the Test Act of 1673 which required all holders of civil and military offices to receive the sacrament according to the Anglican rite and declare their disbelief in transubstantiation

 The Whigs tended to consist of powerful nobles who were jealous of the powers of the Crown, merchants and financiers in London, a number of bishops, and the Dissenters, all people who tended to be united by religious toleration and support of commerce
 Most notably, the emphasis which the medieval Catholic Church had placed on the salvation of the soul after death gave way to an interest in human virtue and morality in this world
  Elizabeth I Although Elizabeth did not eliminate the religious tensions of the preceding twenty years, they retreated to a simmering undercurrent under her strong rule

 However, it was constantly plagued by the exiled descendants of James II, who still had many supporters loyal to the house of Stuart in England and Scotland the supporters were known as Jacobites after the name Jacobus, Latin for James 
 For inspiration, people turned to the Classical Greece and Rome, and much of the aesthetics of the Early Modern Period thus consciously imitates the past
 Charles harboured Catholic sympathies, which he hid until his death for the sake of the peace of his realm
 The implications of these calls went largely unnoticed when Britain lost the American colonies in the 1780s, but they could no longer be ignored when Britons were faced with the French Revolution 1789 just a few miles away
 For this reason, England during the period is often known as Augustan England
 However, not all the tensions of the past were eliminated

 However, by making Mary s son her heir, Elizabeth secured an easy succession for the Scottish king and an easy transition from the Tudor to the Stuart dynasty
 This brought him into increasing conflict with Parliament
  Religious Developments The single, greatest development of the period is the Reformation, the process by which some Christians in western Europe left the Church of Rome to found their own Protestant churches

 However, at Mary s death, she was succeeded by her Protestant half sister Elizabeth I
 When the writers, philosophers and scientists of the eighteenth century referred to their activities as the Enlightenment , they meant that they were breaking from the past and replacing the obscurity, darkness, and ignorance of European thought with the light of truth
 Mary tried to reverse the doctrinal changes which had taken place under her father and half brother, and many of the leading Protestants were forced to flee to the Continent or were burned at the stake

 The problem came to a head in Henry VIII s reign because of his repeated failure to produce a male heir
 Internally, the Queen s courtiers struggled to gain her favour, and, externally, England was able to sway the balance of power in Europe between Spain and France
 As a result, many ideas about social institutions which had been inherited from the Middle Ages were actively questioned and debated at a level not seen before
 Hence the modern system of ministerial government began to develop at this time
 However, his successor was the half Spanish Mary I daughter of Henry VIII s first wife Catherine of Aragon , who was married to Philip II of Spain
 Religious doctrines have no place in the understanding of the physical and human worlds   There are two distinct developments in Enlightenment thought the scientific revolution which resulted in new systems of understanding the physical world and the redeployment of the human sciences that apply scientific thinking to what were normally interpretive sciences

 Charles II secretly hid his own Catholic sympathies and, although he held absolutist views typical of the Stuarts, was too astute a politician to provoke a crisis
  Social and Economic Developments The period from the sixteenth to the early eighteenth century is often referred to as the Early Modern Period because it coincides with the colonization of the New World and the development of new technologies which shaped the world as we know it
 Whilst the English spread to the New World, there was great ambiguity between Scotland and England, which had the same king but separate Parliaments, religious institutions, and systems of taxation

 Jacobite uprisings occurred in 1715 and 1745, until James grandson Charles Edward Stuart Bonnie Prince Charlie was decicively defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746
