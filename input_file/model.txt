 It sought to understand the principles of human behaviour and human societies, giving great attention to public and political affairs
  Charles II and the Restoration When Charles II came to the throne strict limits were placed on his authority over Parliament
  When Anne came to the throne England embarked upon a war with France and Spain between 1702 1713
 Nevertheless, the nation prospered and embarked on a process of empire building
 Mary was the wife of King Philip II of Spain, a staunchly Catholic monarch, and England was immediately riven into pro Catholic and pro Protestant camps, where religious and political divisions were inseparable
  Social and Economic Developments The period from the sixteenth to the early eighteenth century is often referred to as the Early Modern Period because it coincides with the colonization of the New World and the development of new technologies which shaped the world as we know it
 For this reason, the period, particularly from about 1500 1650, has become known as the Renaissance
 The German speaking monarchs had little interest in patronising literature, and writers were forced to turn to publishers for their livelihoods and cater for an expanding readership
 The theatres were closed, the press restricted, and peace was maintained by military force
  The Hanoverian Succession Queen Anne had no heir, so the succession passed to Sophia of Hanover in Germany , the granddaughter of James I, who was Anne s closest Protestant relative
 Hence English society became religiously fragmented
 Against the backdrop of such discontent, James turned to the traditional notion of the divine right of kings to rule, only he interpreted this to mean that his policies could not be challenged by his subjects
 This led Henry to break away from the Catholic Church
 The main components of Enlightenment thought are as follows  1
 In the so called Glorious Revolution of 1688 William crushed James  forces and sent the king into exile
 He had the Catholic monasteries dissolved and re distributed their vast wealth to his courtiers in exchange for their political support
 Parliamentary forces called the Roundheads after the shape of the helmets they wore gradually gained the upper hand against the royalists known as the Cavaliers , and they captured, tried, and executed Charles in 1649
 All human life, both social and individual, can be understood in the same way the natural world can be  understood once understood, human life, both social and individual, can be manipulated or engineered in the same way the natural world can be manipulated or engineered  experience  5
 Humanism also tended employ empirical methodologies to understand the world, as opposed the more theoretical ones taught in medieval universities
 Once the world is understood as a machine, it can be manipulated and engineered for the benefit of humanity in the same way as machines are
 However, his successor was the half Spanish Mary I daughter of Henry VIII s first wife Catherine of Aragon , who was married to Philip II of Spain
 Internally, the Queen s courtiers struggled to gain her favour, and, externally, England was able to sway the balance of power in Europe between Spain and France
 Elizabeth never married and died without an heir in 1603
 The process happened in different ways in different countries, but the English Reformation is a direct result of Henry VIII s conflict with the Pope
 The Royal Navy was built up, and after a series of wars with the Dutch and French between 1680 and 1763, England later Britain acquired dominions that stretched from Canada to India
 However, not all the tensions of the past were eliminated
 But no stable form of government had evolved, and Charles II was recalled from exile in 1660 to take back his father s throne
 However, in 1665 England was struck by an outbreak of the plague, which many considered to be a divine punishment for the death of Charles I
 Not only can we not easily find a beginning to the Enlightenment, we can t really identify an end point either
 Human history is largely a history of progress 6
 It was followed by the Bill of Rights 1689 , which limited the powers of the Crown and reaffirmed the supremacy of Parliament
 However, James did not inherit Elizabeth s personality cult
 These ideas were not abandoned completely, but they were inevitably transformed
 Charles harboured Catholic sympathies, which he hid until his death for the sake of the peace of his realm
 This culminated in the Test Act of 1673 which required all holders of civil and military offices to receive the sacrament according to the Anglican rite and declare their disbelief in transubstantiation
 Secret negotiation ensued to bring William of Orange, the leading Protestant on the Continent and husband of James daughter Mary to the throne
 The war was supported by Whig lords and merchants who grew fabulously wealthy off of war profits and the growing empire which soon stretched from Canada to India
  Charles I and the Civil War The discontent of Elizabeth s and James s reigns came to a head under Charles I
 England was declared a Commonwealth later a Protectorate under the rule of Oliver Cromwell, who commanded the forces of the Roundheads
 Hence the modern system of ministerial government began to develop at this time
  George III s reign was dominated largely by Britain s increasing colonial power and by movements towards a new social order which spread the wealth down to the working classes
 Under Elizabeth, much of the power held by the monarch became invested in Elizabeth herself, creating a cult of personality which touched nearly every aspect of Elizabethan society
 In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the most extreme of these dissenters were called Puritans
 In 1687 he suspended the Test Act and began filling the government and army with Catholics and Dissenters
 In 1556 Philip II 1556 1598 had inherited the possessions of the Hapsburg dynasty in the Netherlands and nearly half of Italy, as well as Spanish holdings in the New World
  The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century    The Restoration Many believed that Charles II would bring order, peace, and freedom under law back to the country after the Civil War
 In the first, the two great innovations were the development of empirical thought and the mechanistic world view
 The implications of these calls went largely unnoticed when Britain lost the American colonies in the 1780s, but they could no longer be ignored when Britons were faced with the French Revolution 1789 just a few miles away
 The universe is fundamentally rational, that is, it can be understood through the use of reason alone 2
 Henry s son by his third wife, Jane Seymour was Edward VI
 During Elizabeth s reign social and religious grievances were muted by her immense authority and effective politicking however, James could not contain discontent in the same way, and unrest steadily grew, particularly against the authority of the king and the Church hierarchy
 Thus began the English Civil War
 Religious doctrines have no place in the understanding of the physical and human worlds   There are two distinct developments in Enlightenment thought the scientific revolution which resulted in new systems of understanding the physical world and the redeployment of the human sciences that apply scientific thinking to what were normally interpretive sciences
 The process accelerated when Henry VIII broke from Rome and made himself Supreme Head of the English Church
 Although the Queen took no responsibility for the activities of English privateers , she sponsored them financially and rewarded them well
  Henry VIII and the Uncertain Succession The Tudor dynasty oversaw the gradual disappearance of the old feudal organisation of England
 In particular, her ability to manipulate her many suitors without ever marrying had the effect of concentrating the glory of the realm more fully in her person, so that she eventually insisted that England itself was her spouse, and her persona as the Virgin Queen became the object of almost religious adulation

 Sophia died before Anne, so her son George I became king
  Elizabeth I Although Elizabeth did not eliminate the religious tensions of the preceding twenty years, they retreated to a simmering undercurrent under her strong rule
   
 Human experience is the foundation of human understanding of truth authority is not to be preferred over  4
 He invaded in 1688 and James was forced to flee to France
 He was succeeded by his elder half sister Mary I
 English nationalism and adoration of its queen became one and the same
 This brought him into increasing conflict with Parliament
 The period of Charles reign is known as the Restoration period, but at the time people looked to Charles to bring a new period of English glory to rival the greatest days of the Roman Empire under Caesar Augustus
 It functions by natural and predictable rules although God created the universe, he does not interfere in its day to day runnings
 Whilst the English spread to the New World, there was great ambiguity between Scotland and England, which had the same king but separate Parliaments, religious institutions, and systems of taxation
 Still, he fostered tremendous cultural achievements the patronage of Shakespeare s theatre and the publication of the King James Bible in 1611 as well as the settlement of Jamestown, Virginia in 1607
 When Cromwell died in 1658, his son Richard briefly succeeded him
 In the turmoil surrounding the Popish Plot, two clearly defined political parties emerged for the first time
 However, he and his successors were dogged by the questionable legitimacy of their dynasty
 However, at this stage, most English activity in the New World consisted of privateering
 The arrival of Puritan settlers at Plymouth, Massachusetts occurred at the end of his reign, in 1620
 During his short reign the religious principles of the Church of England were given a strong doctrinal basis and formalised in 1553
 James was a Protestant and therefore there was no great cultural break between Elizabethan and Jacobean England from Jacobus, the Latin form of James 
 This movement, which had its roots in the Middle Ages but drew much of its influence from the Classical past, is known as Humanism
 Even the Great Fire of London of 1666, which destroyed three quarters of the town, including St Paul s Cathedral, failed to dampen the enthusiasm
 Jacobite uprisings occurred in 1715 and 1745, until James grandson Charles Edward Stuart Bonnie Prince Charlie was decicively defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746
  The Enlightenment The term Enlightenment refers to a series of changes in European thought and letters
 The same process encouraged the further development of courtly culture, as people gathered around the king in order to secure their political advancement
 From then on James and his descendants would be a source of anxiety for the English government
 However, it was constantly plagued by the exiled descendants of James II, who still had many supporters loyal to the house of Stuart in England and Scotland the supporters were known as Jacobites after the name Jacobus, Latin for James 
 Despite the growing power of England, Spain  had become the most powerful nation in Europe
 Many prominent British writers of the eighteenth century came from Scotland or Ireland, suggesting that cultural life was becoming increasingly diverse
 For we still more or less live in an Enlightenment world while philosophers and cultural historians have dubbed the late nineteenth and all of the twentieth century as post Enlightenment , we still walk around with a world view largely based on Enlightenment thought
 Most notably, the emphasis which the medieval Catholic Church had placed on the salvation of the soul after death gave way to an interest in human virtue and morality in this world
  The Glorious Revolution and the Reign of Queen Anne In 1685 James II came to the throne and immediately tried to advance the cause of Catholicism
 The renewed interest in the study of the Classical learning aided by the new ease of acquiring printed editions of ancient texts , led people to think that they were experiencing a re birth, or renaissance, of knowledge and wisdom which they believed had been lost in the Middle Ages
 However, at Mary s death, she was succeeded by her Protestant half sister Elizabeth I
 Mary died in 1694, and William in 1702, to be succeeded by Mary s sister Anne, the last of the Stuart monarchs
  With the king the established Church was also restored, and legislation was soon passed against Dissenters which filled the prisons with nonconformist preachers like John Bunyan 
 Puritan preachers agitated all sectors of society, eventually taking Parliament into direct conflict with the King in 1642
 However, throughout the period, other sects came into being, particularly the Presbyterians, the Anabaptists, and the Quakers
 Although neither Catholics nor reformists were satisfied with her doctrinal reforms, the majority of the population looked to the monarch as the prime source of authority in religion
 Thus Mary was always a potential claimant of the English throne, and Elizabeth was eventually forced to execute her in 1587
 Calls for greater democracy ushered in piecemeal reforms, as Britain wavered between loyalty to old traditions and newer principles based on liberty and human rights
 In the second, the universe is regarded as a machine
 Whilst this did not completely eliminate his power or influence, it did much to assuage the fears of authoritarian rule which had characterised the earlier Stuart period
 For inspiration, people turned to the Classical Greece and Rome, and much of the aesthetics of the Early Modern Period thus consciously imitates the past
 The Toleration Act secured freedom of worship for Dissenters, although it did not abolish the Test Act
 English colonial efforts were focused on Ireland, where a combination of expansionism, nationalism, and religious intolerance led to a subjugation of the Roman Catholic populace and its Celtic culture
 The tensions nearly toppled the kingdom in the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605, an attempt by Catholic extremists to blow up Parliament and the king
  The Union of the Crowns When James VI of Scotland became James I of England, the Stuart dynasty took over from the Tudors with little opposition
 Mary was the grand daughter of Henry VIII s sister Margaret, who had married into the Stuart dynasty of Scotland she was the wife of James IV 
 Protestants known as dissenters objected to the hierarchical nature of the Church of England, and many insisted that there should be no intermediary between man and God, save the Bible
 The accession of William and Mary to the throne as Joint Sovereigns is known as the Glorious Revolution
 Only at the end of Anne s reign did the power shift towards the Tories, largely because Anne refused to undermine the position of the established church
 The problem came to a head in Henry VIII s reign because of his repeated failure to produce a male heir
 The period also saw accelerating urbanization and an economy in which monetary wealth was less synonymous with the ownership of land
 Mary tried to reverse the doctrinal changes which had taken place under her father and half brother, and many of the leading Protestants were forced to flee to the Continent or were burned at the stake
 When James became king, the Dutch Protestant William of Orange, who was married to James daughter Mary, was invited to invade
 England inevitably fostered anti Spanish rebellions by Protestants in the Netherlands, and piracy against Spanish activities in the Americas
 The king s supporters were known as the Tories, and his opponents were called the Whigs
 When the writers, philosophers and scientists of the eighteenth century referred to their activities as the Enlightenment , they meant that they were breaking from the past and replacing the obscurity, darkness, and ignorance of European thought with the light of truth
 Empiricism is based on the notion that human observation is a reliable indicator of the nature of phenomena repeated human observation can produce reasonable expectations about future natural events
 The Tories tended to draw their support from the landed gentry and the country clergy they were conservative and tended to support the Crown and the established church
 In September of 1666 the Great Fire of London raged for four days, destroying a large part of the City, leaving about two thirds of its population homeless and inadvertently eradicating the plague 
 However, by making Mary s son her heir, Elizabeth secured an easy succession for the Scottish king and an easy transition from the Tudor to the Stuart dynasty
 The only major political crisis of his reign was the Popish Plot 1678 81 , an unsuccessful attempt to get him to exclude his Catholic brother James from the succession
 Thereafter, William and Mary ruled as Joint Sovereigns
 At her death, her half sister Elizabeth I daughter of Henry VIII s third wife, Anne Boleyn restored Protestant rule
 Charles II secretly hid his own Catholic sympathies and, although he held absolutist views typical of the Stuarts, was too astute a politician to provoke a crisis
 Most famous amongst the English privateers was Sir Francis Drake, who between 1577 1580 pillaged Spanish towns on the Pacific as far north as San Francisco, sailing around South America and returning with 1 million of booty
 Britain grew increasingly prosperous through war, trade, and the beginnings of industrialism
 Philip II sent an invasion force against Elizabeth in 1588, but the overwhelming defeat of the Spanish Armada secured Elizabeth s position
 In many cases, religious fundamentalists lined themselves up against the new humanist thinking, and religious fervour was often closely linked with superstition, as a result
 As a result, many ideas about social institutions which had been inherited from the Middle Ages were actively questioned and debated at a level not seen before
 Human beings can be improved through education and the development of their rational facilities 7
  Religious Developments The single, greatest development of the period is the Reformation, the process by which some Christians in western Europe left the Church of Rome to found their own Protestant churches
 In the subsequent years the two factions developed opposed attitudes on other important issues
 Mary s accession had been opposed by leading politicians and she had to deal with rebellion throughout her reign
 Witch trials rare occurrences in the Middle Ages became common, one of the later examples being those in Salem, Massachusetts during the 1690s
 Thus began a great age of journalistic writing and periodical literature
 Her designated heir was James VI of Scotland, the son of Mary Queen of Scots 1542 1567 
 Both Protestant Dissenters and Catholics were effectively excluded from public life and frequently accused of treason
 Cromwell, was, if anything, a more authoritarian ruler than Charles was, and religious intolerance increased
 This removed the trade barriers between the two countries and merged their parliaments, with the Parliament of Great Britain in London
 This had the effect of encouraging social mobility, both geographically and hierarchically
 Whilst this led to the establishment of the Church of England, it is important to realise that the established Church did not satisfy all the calls for religious reform in the Early Modern period
 The other important event of the reign is the Act of Union between England and Scotland 1707 
 Both George I and George II were largely unconcerned with British affairs and spoke broken English at best
 After multiple marriages, he did produce a son, the sickly Edward VI, who died six years into his reign
 Henry attempted to remarry, but the Pope refused to dissolve his marriage to Catherine of Aragon
 The Whigs tended to consist of powerful nobles who were jealous of the powers of the Crown, merchants and financiers in London, a number of bishops, and the Dissenters, all people who tended to be united by religious toleration and support of commerce
 The theatres were re opened, and the King sponsored intellectual groups, most notably, the Royal Society, an organisation established to bring together the greatest scientific scholars in England
 Truth can be arrived at through empirical observation, the use of reason, and systematic doubt 3
 The introduction of the printing press to England by William Caxton in 1476 gradually brought about a more literate and print oriented culture
 However, his brother, later James II, made no secret of his desire to return England to Catholicism, and people began to take sides well before Charles death
 For this reason, England during the period is often known as Augustan England
